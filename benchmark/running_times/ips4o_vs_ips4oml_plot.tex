\title{Average slowdown of \compiparassssort and \compiparassssortnts}

\begin{document}

\begin{table}

\caption{
    This table shows the average slowdown of \compiparassssort and
    \compiparassssortnts to the best of both algorithms for different
    array types and machines.  The
    numbers in parentheses show the average running times of
    \compiparassssort divided by $n/t \log_2 n$ in
    nanoseconds.  We only consider inputs with at least
    $2^{21}t$~bytes.}
